    //Thats because of the click to start I added because the game lmade replit lag so much and I needed a way to stop replit from auto-loading the game.
    //But, where are those errors comming from?
    //thankls, so much lag
    //No, thats just because its running on replit.
    //In its own tab its a steady 62.
    //I just fixed that like 2 hours ago, it can't be broken already. Me too, now that I checked.
