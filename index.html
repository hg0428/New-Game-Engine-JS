  So, only the paddle is supposed to have a border
  -->
	<!--
	i dont see a border around any of the things
  also, you have to use compile.py
  I added that because it was the best way I could find to organize the code without adding modules and stuff.
  engine/shape-color.js
  This was working on my local version...
  But there is an error here.
	yea ok, ColorScheme not defined?
	It was working on my local one
  I think I pulled.
	oh wait I might have not pulled
	oh ok
  why wont it tell the line num in errors
  I ran it too.
  What line num is the error on??????
  How did you find that?
  I ran compile.py still errors. 
  Oh, I forgot about that.
	Breakout.js line 11, ColorScheme is not defined
	I open it in a new tab and use chrome devtools, because I dont like the built in ones
	//Im going to check the engine.min.js and make sure its there
	Ok
	Different error now, in engine.min.js line 209
  Working now!

    })();//Ok, so, the game engine works great already, I made some bug fixes recently, like when we used canvas instead of this.canvas, and some other minor things that broke the entire program. //
    //Thats because of the click to start I added because the game lmade replit lag so much and I needed a way to stop replit from auto-loading the game.
    //But, where are those errors comming from?
    //thanks, so much lag
    //No, thats just because its running on replit.
    //In its own tab its a steady 62.
    //I just fixed that like 2 hours ago, it can't be broken already. Me too, now that I checked.
